            <p>First, and foremost, I'm a father and a husband. I have been married for 20 years come this march. I have two daughters who are 16 and 10. My family and I have traveled the globe during my career in the Army. I was a Flight instructor on the Black Hawk helicopter, and the Huey. I retired on the first of August 2020, and have my sights set on being a Software Engineer.</p>

                <p>Since I can no longer fly for the Army, I get my fill of flying in the mode of First Person View drones. I love to build, tune and fly these racing/freestyle drones as much as I can.</p>
